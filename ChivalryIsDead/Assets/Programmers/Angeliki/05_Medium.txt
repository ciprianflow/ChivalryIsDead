I will give you anything please just find her for me! /My wife left me for a M’grell. I want to act out on my anger, but my therapist doesn’t recommend it. Could you be angry in my stead? Kill some M’grells whilst yelling “WHY JUDITH”, please. /I befriended a Troll called Høgrid, who keeps showing up at my door late at night and tells me I’m a wizard. It’s pissing me off quite a bit. Could you remove him and his friends for me? /I accidentally stepped on a tiny fairy in the forest yesterday, and now she has cursed me! Trolls are following me around! Go out and kill them! /There is this crazy homeless M’grell who keeps bothering my family for food, can’t you end my pain and bloody murder him for me? /The local monsters have decided to use my land to build a beach volleyball court! Can you believe this?! /My last harvest ended badly, and to make matters worse now some of the local monsters have decided to camp up in my fields! /I broke my grandfather clock and it turned out to hold a curse inside it! Now my land is filled with monsters!
