I have buried all but one of my children. We’re starving, and now some trolls have decided to live on our lands, please! We can’t take this anymore! /I have stood in this line for 2 full weeks instead of taking care of my sick children. Please save us from the beasts that haunts our lands! /I lost all of my teeth to the plague, and now those bloody monsters have decided to move into our fields. I’d do anything for a boiled down shoe or half-eaten carrot! /My family and I haven’t eaten for days. We used to eat our sheep, but we can’t anymore because some monsters have decided to eat them for us instead! /I got a fork to protect me against the rats in the night, but now bigger monsters are harassing me. Maybe you could use your big fork to cut them down? /My poor family got me a nice shovel for christmas, but now some monsters stole it! Kill them for me please!
