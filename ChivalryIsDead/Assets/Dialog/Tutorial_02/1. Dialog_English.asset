  - Remember when I said I had a plan before?
  - "Here\u2019s my idea!"
  - "So to escape the marriage, but also avoid a royal execution\u2026"
  - "What if you just started to suck\u2026"
  - Like ... suck a lot?
  - If you became the worst knight in the kingdom of Pecoria,
  - "nobody would want your help, not even the peasants!\r"
  - And if nobody would want your help,
  - then surely the king would not let you become his son-in-law, out of pure embarrassment!
  - "So I got an idea, let\u2019s move over to where the action is at!\r"
