  - "Some monsters bullied my family in front of me, I have prayed for their sins,
    but could you chase them away so my family can catch a break? /Some M\u2019grells
    are bullying my child for being poor, Billy is already perfoming poorly in peasant
    school, could you tell the M\u2019grells to leave him alone please? /I fear that
    my monster-neighbours have a meth-lab in their backyard, could you scare them
    away, peacefully, so as to not raise more suspicion than necessary? \r/Some monsters
    are fighting over my sheep, could you resolve that conflict peacefully please?"
