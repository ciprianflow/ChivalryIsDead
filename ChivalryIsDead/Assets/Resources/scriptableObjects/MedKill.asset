  - "There are some monsters in my backyard! I come from the local peasant-hippie
    society, so I implore you to NOT use violence on them!\r /My Ma used to say that
    violence never solves anything, so that is why I hope that you might peacefully
    persuade those M\u2019grells to leave my property nice and quiet like. /My wife
    slept with a monster because I lost a bet, and now that bloody thing won\u2019t
    leave us alone, could you resolve this, uhm, peacefully? /The local monsters have
    decided to use my land to build a football field! Can you believe this?! Get rid
    of them, but not with bloodshed, it\u2019s so hard to get rid of it once it\u2019s
    been splattered! /I don\u2019t believe in violence, so when I got beat up by those
    invading trolls, I had to pause and wonder if I had picked the right religion.
    Get rid of the monsters, peacefully of course.\r /I consider myself a peaceful
    kind of fellow, some local monsters are stealing my sheep whilst calling me a
    \u201Chippie-loser\u201D, could you scare them away please? /Some monsters are
    fighting over my sheep, could you resolve that conflict peacefully please?\n"
