  - "I have buried all but one of my children. We\u2019re starving, and now some trolls
    have decided to live on our lands, please! We can\u2019t take this anymore! /I
    have stood in this line for 2 full weeks instead of taking care of my sick children.
    Please save us from the beasts that haunts our lands! /I lost all of my teeth
    to the plague, and now those bloody monsters have decided to move into our fields.
    I\u2019d do anything for a boiled down shoe or half-eaten carrot! /My family and
    I haven\u2019t eaten for days. We used to eat our sheep, but we can\u2019t anymore
    because some monsters have decided to eat them for us instead! /I got a fork to
    protect me against the rats in the night, but now bigger monsters are harassing
    me. Maybe you could use your big fork to cut them down? /My poor family got me
    a nice shovel for christmas, but now some monsters stole it! Kill them for me
    please!"
