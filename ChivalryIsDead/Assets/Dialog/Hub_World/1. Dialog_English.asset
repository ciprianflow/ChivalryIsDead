  - "Okay, so basically let\u2019s NOT get married to the horrible princess.\r"
  - "But we can\u2019t openly say no to her either\u2026 You saw what happened to
    sir Yesmann, when he refused the girl."
  - "The body parts still haunts my tiny metal mind\u2026\r"
  - Listen, Triheart. I got an idea, the only reason that the princess likes you,
    is because you are a famous knight!
  - So what if you just started to suck? If you became the worst knight? Surely then
    the princess would be too embarrassed to marry you!
