I woke up to the surprise of having my lawn filled with dirty beasts! Tonight is bingo night, be a darling and rid me of those dirty things! /My servant, Woodhouse, was found this morning with a spear through his throat. Now I have to get a new servant and they don’t exactly grow on trees! Rid me of his killers! /I have the best words! The absolute best words. No one has better words than me, but monsters are protesting my new wall. Kill them for me, willya? /My personal trainer recommends me that I drink 2 cups of troll blood a day to keep my internal stress clock down. Would you get some for me? /Some of my sheep got lost last night, I would find them myself but I don’t want to get any dirt on my expensive clothes./As a rich philanthropist peasant, I tried to educate some of the local monsters. Sadly it failed and now they won’t leave me. Get rid of them, please.
