  - "I woke up to the surprise of having my lawn filled with dirty beasts! Tonight
    is bingo night, be a darling and rid me of those dirty things! /My servant, Woodhouse,
    was found this morning with a spear through his throat. Now I have to get a new
    servant and they don\u2019t exactly grow on trees! Rid me of his killers! /I have
    the best words! The absolute best words. No one has better words than me, but
    monsters are protesting my new wall. Kill them for me, willya? /My personal trainer
    recommends me that I drink 2 cups of troll blood a day to keep my internal stress
    clock down. Would you get some for me? /Some of my sheep got lost last night,
    I would find them myself but I don\u2019t want to get any dirt on my expensive
    clothes./As a rich philanthropist peasant, I tried to educate some of the local
    monsters. Sadly it failed and now they won\u2019t leave me. Get rid of them, please."
