  - "Since the war my family has been scraping by, but now some explosive goblins
    and other monsters are harassing us! Can you help? /My daughter has been kidnapped!
    Help, please find her for us! I will give you anything please just find her for
    me! /My wife left me for a M\u2019grell. I want to act out on my anger, but my
    therapist doesn\u2019t recommend it. Could you be angry in my stead? Kill some
    M\u2019grells whilst yelling \u201CWHY JUDITH\u201D, please. /I befriended a Troll
    called H\xF8grid, who keeps showing up at my door late at night and tells me I\u2019m
    a wizard. It\u2019s pissing me off quite a bit. Could you remove him and his friends
    for me? /I accidentally stepped on a tiny fairy in the forest yesterday, and now
    she has cursed me! Trolls are following me around! Go out and kill them! /There
    is this crazy homeless M\u2019grell who keeps bothering my family for food, can\u2019t
    you end my pain and bloody murder him for me? /The local monsters have decided
    to use my land to build a beach volleyball court! Can you believe this?! /My last
    harvest ended badly, and to make matters worse now some of the local monsters
    have decided to camp up in my fields! /I broke my grandfather clock and it turned
    out to hold a curse inside it! Now my land is filled with monsters!"
