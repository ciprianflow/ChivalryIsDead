  - Yoohoooo!!
  - Who was that?
  - "My lovely sir Heart! It\u2019s me, your\ndarling devotee! Future wife and\nqueen!"
  - "I can hear her, but I can\u2019t see her."
  - Oh sir Triheart! I am seeing you through my magical mirror!
  - I once asked it if I was the most beautiful girl in the kingdom.
  - "When it showed me an image of some dirty lowborn instead of me\u2026\r"
  - I smashed it to pieces!
  - "Daddy fixed it up, but now it only dares show me images that won\u2019t offend
    me.\r"
  - "Jeez\u2026 Well, at least she\u2019s not here physically."
